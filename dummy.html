  <h2 class="note">A Note about 'Me and My Beloved'</h2>
  <p>Eventhough the word pandemic appears scary for many, it doesn't invoke a sense of fear in me. In fact, my experience suggest that this corona time is a blessing for me </p><br>
  <p>Shilpa, I suppose u already know where i'm headingüòÄ. Let me explain in brief. First of all, just before the part of world where i reside realised the extent of threat this virus pose and imposed a country wide lockdown, I safely reached my home.</p><br>
  <p>Then for the next four full months, my generous company paid me full salary without me doing any work. At that point I thought, this is possibly the best thing that happened to me in a long time. </p><br>
  <p>But what god planned for me was way better and significant.</p><br>
  <p>I knew marriage is something unavoidable, but i tried to delay it despite i felt need of a partner deperately. The reason for this was i felt i maybe unable to maintain a work - life balance because of my work location and payscale.</p><br>
  <p>Despite of me pulling myself from marriage, the hand of god lead me to the matrimony site where i found u. The 'god's plan' factor is real I believe, because i argued with my parents and relatives when they compelled me to get married a few weeks back before we spoke first. </p><br>
  <p>Still skeptical of my decision to find a partner, I was passive in matrimony site till I saw ur profile. I was very nervous during our first virtual meeting, but u seemed cool. </p><br>
  <p> But I knew somehow we both are meant for each other. After few days of conversation, u actually made me comfortable and my nervousness moved aside for fontness.</p><br>
  <p>Now here I stand after 2 months of our interaction where I believe u got an outline of who I am.</p>
  <p>I never said this to anybody in my life...I'm blindly in Love with you Ammu..So so very much I love You and I doubt my love and affection towards you can be expressed in words to it's full extent.</p><br>
  <p>What I can do is love you till I live and be with you always, everywhere, everytime (but once in a while allow me to chill with friends when we come homeüòÉ). You are such a special person for me and never in my life i felt this wholeness just by the thought that you are there for me. I always felt a void in my life, a feeling of incompleteness and now I don't feel it anymore.   </p><br>
  <p>I admire you for who you are and respect your brave decision to leave your most loved family, to achieve an independent life.The way you shaped your life and leading it the way you want it to be is amazing in my view.</p>
  <p>We haven't yet started our life together. In fact, we are yet to meet in real. But whenever i think of you, i just thank god for creating us for each other. I really feel grateful to have you in my life and I'm sure you will be a blessing in my life</p><br>
  <p>I was in a confusion that what should I do for your birthday. I even sought advise from my friends and they suggested me to arrange a surprise gift with help of your friends there. But, what I felt was to write you what I feel for you.</p><br>
  <p>I'm not that good at expressing my emotions and mostly I try to conceal it from others. But,  I felt that through written words, I can better communicate my thoughts and it's unfair to not express my strong love for you long (eventhough we both know we love each).</p><br>
  <p>It's been so many days i'm in love with you and was waiting for a special moment to say this to you. I want to let you know that I can't stop thinking about you and I do that all the time. I pray to god that he let us love each other every moment and even if I lose everything, I just want you by my side. </p><br>
